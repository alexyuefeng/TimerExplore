Trying things out
To prepare for CSE110 group project :)



## Current Version: 3/3/2021

Fixed some minor problems which could cuase the display go wrong




<br />



Past Version:
-You can now set the timer! Be careful, the maximum minute is set to be 480mins which is 8 hours, pls don't work overtime, thank you!

-keyboard shortcut is added too! you can now press "s" on your keyboard to start/stop the timer.

-CSS added, a nicer look.

-A 25mins timer with Start/Stop button.

-A 25mins timer with reset button using localStorage to save time when closing/refreshing the page.

-A 25mins timer with reset button. Kind of useless but whatever.
